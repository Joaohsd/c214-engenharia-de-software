# **Unit Test**

I've created an test scenario for the search of user in a list of JSON. So, the function findUserById is commonly used in many applications. In other to test it, I've created two test cases:

*   Finding an user with an existing ID;
*   Finding an user with a non-existent ID;

## **Pre-requirements**
---
*   Node (used v18.17.1)
*   Npm (used v9.6.7)

## **Test**
---
In order to **Test** the project, use the command below:

```shell
npm i
npm test
```

If you do not have **node** installed, install it! You can use (**for Linux environment**):

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
```
The **npm** already comes with **node**.

**In this project, it was used a newer version of node. Maybe, it can not work with the version present in apt repository**
