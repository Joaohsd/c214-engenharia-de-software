# **Build Automation and Dependency Management**

* **Build Automation:**
It refers to the practice of automating the process of compiling, testing, and packaging a software application. It involves scripting and configuring build tasks to reduce manual intervention, minimize errors, and streamline the deployment process. Build automation tools help developers automate repetitive tasks such as compiling source code, running tests, and creating distributable packages, resulting in more efficient and reliable software development workflows.

*   **Dependency Management:**
It refers to the process of handling and organizing external libraries, packages, or modules that your project relies on. It involves ensuring that the necessary dependencies are available, up to date, and compatible with your application. Dependency management tools like npm (Node Package Manager), pip (Python package manager), or Maven (for Java) help automate the process of installing, updating, and resolving dependencies, making it easier to maintain a project's stability and functionality.
